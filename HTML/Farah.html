<p style="color:#38C70A; font-size: 20">
My name is Farah Tabira. I am really quiet, reserved, and introverted as a person. I am also a religious and pious Muslim. I try to remember Almighty Allah in every single thing I do because He is the most Merciful one and only He can help us in our times of need, danger or crisis. I try to follow the path and guidelines shown to us by the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), who is the Messenger of Allah. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is my idol and favorite person.</p>

I am a bookworm by nature. Books mean everything to me. A book full of drama and suspense has the power to have me glued to it till the last page. My favorite genres are thrriller, mystery, detective, young adult, chick literature, fantasy and science fiction. I love books belonging to any of these categories if they happen to be gripping, intriguing and full of adventure and surprises.

<p>
Moreover, I have in depth knowledge in other categories other than computer science. This includes art history and science history, evolutionary theory, human behavior. I wish to write about the above mentioned topics if I start writing as a blog writer. I have written book reviews on goodreads, where i have an account and upload the names of books i am currently reading, have already read or plan to read in the future. I am a youtube junkie because i like watching their videos to gather knowledge on a wide variety of topics, starting from international designer brands like chanel, louis vuitton, etc to blockbuster novels. I know a whole lot about international fashion brands and in my spare time i sometimes write about what clothing pieces to style with what other pieces or accessories. I love fashion and love reading and writng about the latest styles and trends. Another way i spend my leisure is by reading books. I have read six books this year till now. I love bestselling novels and find them intriguing. I am good in English literature which is reflected in my achievement of A in English in my O levels. I also received the Commonwealth Highly Commended Certificate in 2004 for an essay I wrote for the Commonwealth Essay Competition. I love collecting stickers. i really love listening to music and  believe i can write a blog on international music if i start blogging. I have a broad knowledge on pop, rock, hard rock, hip hop musicians and bands from the 90s till now. I love shopping like every other girl next door.
